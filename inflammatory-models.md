# Inflammatory Models

## Models

Nearly all inflammatory models involve the delivery of a substance that is used to elicit an inflammatory response in the vicinity of sensory neurons. The major models of inflammation - CFA, Zymosan and Carrageenan - induce a complex inflammatory response from host immune cells, resulting in the release of mediator substances \(e.g. cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids\), which then act on sensory neurons. In some cases, the mediators themselves are delivered directly to test the effect of a specific mediator on sensory neurons.
